# pyMMF documentation


## pyMMF

`pyMMF` is a Python package designed to compute modes of multimode fibers 
under the scalar approximation.
It includes a set of [solvers](#solvers) suited for different types of fiber or apporoximations.
  
  
## Installation

Stable realease:

```bash
pip install pymmf
```

Latest GitHub version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/pyMMF.git
```

## Usage


### Basic workflow

The workflow to compute modes of a multimode fiber is the following

1. Create a [`IndexProfile`](IndexProfile) object and set the parameters
   to represent the index profile of the fiber.
2. Create and set up a [`propagationModeSolver`](propagationModeSolver) object.
3. Run the solver 

## Solvers

### Step index solver

```python

```
