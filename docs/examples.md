# Examples

## Example 1

Solving the modes of a GRIN index fiber using the `radial` solver.

```

## Example 2

Solving the modes of a step index fiber and comparing the results of the `radial` solver 
to the semi-analytical (`SI` solver) solution of the wave equation, the `WKB` approximation, 
and the results of FTD (Comsol) simulations.

## Example 3

Solving a system with a non-axisymmetrical index profile, a square-core fiber, 
using the `eig2D` solver.

## Example 4

Comparing the results from the different solver for a graded index fiber 
with the results from FDTD simulations.
